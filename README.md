# Java-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

This was my coursework material for a Data Structures and Algorithms class that I took
from UC Berkeley in Spring 2020.

Of note the final project for the course, proj3 was written almost entirely from scratch
and emulates several features of the popular version control platform Git.
