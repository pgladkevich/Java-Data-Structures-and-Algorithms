Q: Is one GrowList implementation always better than the others?
A: No. It depends on the size of the array passed into the algorithms and the number of elements at which an algorithm spikes.

Q: Why is the runtime for N insertions into a geometrically resizing list a Theta(N) operation?
A: Because a geometrically resizing list will have an amortized time that evens out its doubling operation that expands
the size of the list. So even though it will spike at the elements where it needs to double the size of the list, the
other elements all have a Theta(1) insertion time since the list is already expanded. This results in an amortized time
of Theta(N) for N insertions.

Q: Why is the runtime for N insertions into a arithmetically resizing list a Theta(N^2) operation?
A: Because an arithmetically resizing list has to not only create a new list every time, but copy over the old elements
into the new list. The combination of these two actions results in a Theta(N^2) operation.

Q: How does the runtime per operation for the ArithGrowList compare to that of GeomGrowList and JavaGrowList? Specifically look at the non-accumulated plots and desribe the trends for how long each operation takes as a function of how many elements have already been inserted in the list.
A: GeomGrowList and JavaGrowList spike at regular intervals that relates to how they expand the arrays. On the other
handIt seems to spike at irregular intervals which I do not know the reason for. There must be a higher cost associated
with some ArrayCopy parameters compared to others.

Q: When are there spikes in the per operation runtime graphs for each of the implementations? Do these make sense to you? Hint: some of these should and others might not. Empirical runtime can be quite messy and depends on machine specifics which will be revealed in other subsequent classes like CS61C.
A: Again, as in the previous question the GeomGrowList and JavaGrowList are expanding their size by two in the case
of the former and by a different constant (that might change?) in the case of the latter. This results in spikes that
are more consistent. The ArithGrowList spikes don't make sense.

Q: Optional: Try changing the code for GeomGrowList to resize by a different factor. How does this effect the theoretical asymptotic runtime? How does this effect the plotted runtime?
A: This change would not affect the theoretical asymptotic runtime as it is simply multiplying by a different constant
factor and is in the same class of big Theta notation. The plotted runtime is vastly improved.

Q: Optional: Try changing the code for ArithGrowList to resize by adding a different fixed number of spots in the array. How does this effect the theoretical asymptotic runtime? How does this effect the plotted runtime?
A: Adding more additional spots in the array does not affect the theoretical asymptotic run time since it is still
n operations to copy the existing list and n+1 operations to add them to the new one for a total big theta of n^2.
This increases the plotted runtime for the arrays of size equal to or less than the fixed array size. This is because
there are leftover elements that are filled with 0 that are getting copied over each time uselessly.
