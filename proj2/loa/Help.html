<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.

<h2>Rules</h2>
** THE BELOW RULES HAVE BEEN COPIED FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LOA CS61B. Copyright (C) 2015, 2020 PAUL N. HILFINGER
  AND THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. **

    <p>Play alternates between Black and White, with Black moving first. Each move consists of moving a piece of your color
    horizontally, vertically, or diagonally onto an empty square or onto a square occupied by an opposing piece, which is
    then removed from the board. A piece may jump over friendly pieces (without disturbing them), but may not cross enemy
    pieces, except one that it captures. A piece must move a number of squares that is exactly equal to the total number of
    pieces (black and white) on the line along which it chooses to move (the line of action). This line contains both the
    squares behind and in front of the piece that moves, as well as the square the piece is on. A piece may not move off
    the board, onto another piece of its color, or over an opposing piece.</p>

  <p>To move a piece, click on the piece and then drag to the square to which you wish to move it. If it is a valid move
    then the square will now contain your piece and the board will be updated. The Settings menu allows you to choose
    which side(s) are played by automated players or manual players (Which allows you to switch sides), and to set
    a random seed that provides any random factor that the automated players may choose to use (so that they play
    identically when given the same seed). The new button under the game tab will refresh to the original setup.
    Undo will retract a set of moves (one turn per player). Set
    up mode allows you to change the amount of black and
